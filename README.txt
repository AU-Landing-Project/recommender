This is a collaborative filtering recommender system for Elgg, commissioned by Athabasca University. It was started by Aleksandar Giljanovic, who has since passed away. It almost works, albeit with only a simple and unattractive widget front end.
Forks, extensions and modifications greatly welcomed.
